If irssi crashes, please build irssi with debug symbols and the module irssi-xmpp
in debug mode (take a look at "config.mk" to activate it). Then you can run
irssi in gdb and show the backtrace ("bt full") when irssi crashes.
Paste the backtrace in your message would help to find this critical bug.
