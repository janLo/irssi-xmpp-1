About:
======

irssi-xmpp is an irssi plugin to connect to the Jabber network.

Installation:
=============

Requirement:
    o Loudmouth 1.x (http://www.loudmouth-project.org/)
    o Irssi and its sources unpacked and configured (http://irssi.org/)
    o GNU make

Procedure:
    $ export IRSSI_INCLUDE=/path/to/irssi/sources
	$ make
	$ make user-install

Note: On non-Linux systems (e.g. *BSD) you might need to use "gmake" instead of
"make".

Running irssi-xmpp:
===================

Usage:
    /LOAD xmpp

Simply load the module in irssi. Currently you cannot load it automaticly,
unless using a script or something like that.

The module must be placed in "~/.irssi/modules/", or you should load it with
the full path.

You can unload it using:
    /UNLOAD xmpp

Connection:
===========

Usage:
    /SERVER [-ssl] -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

The "jid" is your Jabber ID (something like "username@server"). You can add
"/<ressource>" at the end of the "jid" to set your own ressource.

If 0 is specified as port, the default port will be user (5222 for a regular
connection or 5223 for SSL).

You can put these things in your config file (The config file can be found
here : "~.irssi/config"):

To create a XMPP network, add to chatnets section,
    <network> = { type = "XMPP"; nick = "<jid>"; };

Then you can add this to servers section:
    { address = "<address>"; port="<port>"; use_ssl = "{yes|no}"; chatnet = "<network>"; password = "password"; };

Or in irssi, you can type this:
	/SERVER ADD -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

Now you can connect to your jabber account by typing:
    /CONNECT <network>

Register:
=========

Currently, you cannot register an account with irssi-xmpp. You must do that
with another client.

General commands:
=================

/QUERY <jid>[/<ressource>]
    Starts a private conversation with the JID. If the user is online and 
    the ressource isn't specified, the convestion window will be on the
    ressource with the highest priority.
    
/MSG <jid>[/<ressource>] <message>
    Send a message to a jid.

/AWAY [away|chat|dnd|xa] <reason>
    This command marks you as being "away". If the away mode is'nt specified,
    the "xmpp_default_away_mode" setting will be used. You can remove your away
    status by using AWAY with no arguments.

/ROSTER
    Show your contacts in a list.

/QUOTE <data>
    Sends server raw data without parsing. You need to make sure the value is
    valid XML yourself.

Subscription commands:
======================

    Accept a subscription request, so the contact'll be able to see your
    presence.

/ROSTER DENY <jid>
    Deny a subscription, so the contact won't see your presence anymore.

irssi-xmpp was inspired by irssi-jabber, another jabber module for irssi which
was written by Chistian Häggström. (http://kalvdans.no-ip.org/trac/irssi-jabber)
