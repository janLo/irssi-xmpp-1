1. Connection:
==============

1.1 How can I automatically load irssi-xmpp at irssi startup ?

Simply put "irssi-xmpp" in your startup file (~/.irssi/startup):
    echo "irssi-xmpp" >> ~/.irssi/startup


1.2 How can I automatically connect to my account at irssi startup ?

You can put these things in your config file (The config file can be found
here : "~/.irssi/config"):

To create a XMPP network, add to chatnets section:
  <network> = {
    type = "XMPP";
    nick = "<jid>";
  };

Then you can add this at the end of the servers section:
  {
    address = "<address>";
    port="<port>";
    use_ssl = "{yes|no}";
    chatnet = "<network>";
    password = "<password>";
    autoconnect = "{yes|no}";
  };

Or in irssi, you can type this:
    /SERVER ADD -xmppnet <network> <address> <port> <password> <jid>

If 0 is specified as port, the default port will be used (5222 for a regular
connection or 5223 for SSL).

Now you can connect to your jabber account by typing:
    /CONNECT <network>
Or just restart irssi if you have set autoconnect to yes.
